# 30daysJsChallenge-Sorting-Band-Names-without-articles.
Day 17 of the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge: Learned how to use JavaScript to sort and display a list of bands alphabetically while ignoring common articles (e.g., "the," "a") in their names. Additionally, learned how to manipulate the HTML document using JavaScript to dynamically generate and update content on a webpage.
